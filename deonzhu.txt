Ingredients:

400g firm tofu, drained and cut into cubes
300g shrimp, peeled and deveined
30ml soy sauce
30ml oyster sauce
15ml sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
10g ginger, minced
1 red chili, thinly sliced (optional)
15ml vegetable oil
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 small onion, thinly sliced
2 green onions, sliced for garnish
Sesame seeds, for garnish
Cooked rice, for serving
Instructions:

In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Add the tofu cubes and gently toss to coat. Let marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

In a large skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the marinated tofu cubes and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove tofu from the skillet and set aside.

In the same skillet, add a little more oil if needed, then add the minced garlic, ginger, and red chili (if using). Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook until they turn pink and opaque, about 2-3 minutes.

Add the sliced bell peppers and onion to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they are tender-crisp.

Return the cooked tofu to the skillet and toss everything together until heated through.

Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds.

Serve the shrimp tofu stir-fry hot over cooked rice.
