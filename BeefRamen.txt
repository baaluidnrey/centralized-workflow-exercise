Ingredients:

For the broth:

1.9 liters beef broth (homemade or store-bought)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
5 cm piece of ginger, sliced
30 ml soy sauce
30 ml mirin (Japanese rice wine)
15 ml sesame oil
Salt and pepper to taste
For the beef:

450 grams beef sirloin, thinly sliced
30 ml soy sauce
15 ml sesame oil
15 ml brown sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
15 ml vegetable oil
For assembling:

4 packs of ramen noodles (discard the seasoning packets)
4 soft-boiled eggs
2 green onions, sliced
120 grams baby spinach
Sesame seeds, for garnish
Nori (seaweed sheets), for garnish
Instructions:

In a large pot, combine the beef broth, garlic, onion, ginger, soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

While the broth is simmering, prepare the beef. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, and minced garlic. Add the sliced beef and toss to coat evenly. Let it marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef slices and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a separate pot, cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

To assemble the ramen bowls, divide the cooked noodles among four bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles, then add the cooked beef slices, soft-boiled eggs (halved), baby spinach, and sliced green onions.

Garnish with sesame seeds and torn nori sheets.

Serve hot and enjoy your delicious beef ramen!
