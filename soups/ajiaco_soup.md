# Ajiaco
*Recipe from : https://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/ajiaco-bogotano-colombian-chicken-and/*

## Ingredients
**Chicken:** I like to use bone in chicken breast to add more flavor to the soup, but feel free to use boneless if you prefer.

**Water:** You can replace it for chicken or vegetable broth.

**Herbs:** you need [guascas](https://blog.amigofoods.com/index.php/colombian-food/guascas/) to make ajiaco. I find them dried in small bags online here in the United States, but in Colombia you will find them fresh. I also like to add fresh cilantro to my soup, but if you don't like the flavor just omit it.

**Vegetables:** You need three different kinds of potatoes to make this soup (red, white and small yellow potatoes (papa criolla) an Andean potato). If you don't have papa criolla, you can replace it with small yellow potatoes. Garlic, corn and Scallions give extra flavor to this dish.

To serve this soup you will need heavy cream and capers.

## Instructions
In a large pot, place the chicken, corn, chicken bouillon, cilantro, scallions, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the water and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook for about 30 to 35 minutes, until chicken is cooked and tender. Remove the chicken and set aside.

Continue cooking the corn for about 15 more minutes. Discard green onions and add red potatoes, white potatoes, and the guascas. Cook for 15 more minutes.

Uncover and add the frozen papa criolla and simmer for 15 minutes, season with salt and pepper.

Shred the chicken breast and return to the pot. Serve the Ajiaco hot with capers and heavy cream on the side.
