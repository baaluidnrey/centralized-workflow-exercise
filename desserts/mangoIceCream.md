#MangoIceCream 
## Ingredients
2 large mangoes , ripe and juicy - to make 2 cups puree (Note 1)
395 g / 14 oz sweetened condensed milk (1 can)
 2 cups thickened cream / heavy cream / whipping cream , cold
1/8 tsp yellow liquid food colouring (optional) 
## Instructions
    Dice the flesh of the mango (see video for how I do it). Puree using a blender, food processor or stick blender then measure out 2 cups of mango puree (about 2 1/4 cups of diced mango).
    Pour puree into a non stick skillet over medium low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, for 8 - 10 minutes or until it reduces by half. The test is when you can drag a wooden spoon across the skillet and the path remains there for a second (see video). Or measure out the puree to ensure it's reduced to at least 1 cup - less is even better!
    Cool puree.

## Ice Cream

   1.  Combine cooled mango and condensed milk in a bowl. Add food colouring if using. Whisk until combined.
      1.  Beat cream with a hand held beater or stand mixer until stiff peaks form (see video).
      1.  Take a scoop of cream and put it in the mango mixture. Fold through until mostly combined - lumps is fine (this is just to lighten it up a bit).
   1.     Then pour the mango mixture into the cream. Fold through (see video) rather than mixing vigorously like you would cake batter, until lump free. This will take a few minutes.
    1.    Pour into a container (preferably with a lid). I recommend glass, if you can, or other non reactive container.
    1.    Place a piece of baking / parchment paper on the surface. Then place lid on or using cling wrap.
    Freeze for 12+ hours.
     1.   Remove parchment paper. Stand for 5 minutes to soften slightly, then scoop and serve!
   1.     If frozen for 24 hours or longer, it will need a couple of extra minutes to soften to a scoop able consistency.
